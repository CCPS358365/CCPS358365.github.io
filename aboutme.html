    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> I am working towards goals in my personal and professional life is I'm going to school, trying to stay on the right track and also getting a close relationship with my creator. I also wanna do a LPN program which I would complete after I graduate. The experiences that led me here is I come from a family of nurses and it is also my interest as well. I know I have stuff that needs to be done and I wanna graduate. The values I consider most necessary is getting a close relationship with my creator is cause he is amazing and all the things I've been through in life, he always there for me, I just know he will be the one to give me the strength to not give up and stay dedicated. Short terms goals I would have to accomplish now to graduate is to stay on top of my work and pass all my classes. In the future I would have to complete a practical nursing program and pass the licensing exam. The character traits I would want to be known for is compassion, patience, and good communication skills just so able to maneuver well with everyone else. </p>
